        <p>The Durga temple is an early 8th-century Hindu temple located in Aihole, Karnataka, India. Originally dedicated to Surya, it has the most embellished and largest relief panels in Aihole depicting artwork of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Vedic deities. Apart from its fine carvings, it is notable for its apsidal plan – a rare example among early Chalukyan Hindu temple architecture.

          Though dedicated to Surya, the temple is now named Durga because a durg or fortified lookout was constructed on top of it after the 13th-century during the wars between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic Sultanates. This rubble lookout survived through the 19th-century when this site was rediscovered (it is now gone, temple has been restored). The Durga temple is the most prominent attraction in 
          Aihole for tourist and scholars. It is a part of a pending UNESCO World Heritage Site application.
         <br><br> <b>Date:</b><br>The temple has been dated between the late 7th century and early 8th-century of the early Chalukya dynasty.[3] According to Dhaky and Meister – scholars of Indian temple architecture, an inscription discovered in the 1970s confirms that this temple was originally dedicated to Surya, built by someone named Kumara, but does not include a date. On paleographic grounds, 
         the inscription cannot be later than c. 700 CE.</div><div><b>Artwork:</b><br>Parts of the Durga temple have been damaged, including the artwork it had originally. Some panels are missing, for others the iconography helps identify the identity of the deity or depicted theme. The major artworks are found on the entrance pillars, mukhamandapa pillars, first two bays of the ambulatory and some of the 
          panels around the apsidal ambulatory. The outermost pillars towards the apsidal section are plain.[1]

          As the devotee enters the temple, she or he witnesses dvarapalas, along with scenes of artha and kama (mithuna, erotic happy couples) from the everyday life on pillars and pilaster through the mukhamandapa. Below, near the base of the porch and mandapas are smaller panels that contain scenes from the Hindu epic Ramayana.[3]
          
          The gudha-mandapa's doorframe has six shakhas – concentric bands of artwork. These are Naga, Valli, Stambha, Mithuna, Valli and Bahya-style decoration bands. At the base of this doorframe are goddess Ganga and Yamuna, with their traditional attendants. As one gets closer to the sanctum, the artwork shows deities, and legends associated with dharma themes and scenes. The major dharma panels are in 
          the ambulatory passage. These includes (along the traditional Hindu-style clockwise circumambulation):<br>-> missing panel<br>
          -> Vrishavahana (Shiva with vahana Nandi)<br>
          -> Narasimha (Man-lion avatar of Vishnu)<br>
          -> Vishnu with vahana Garuda<br><br>
          <b>Architecture:</b><br>The Durga temple has an apsidal plan for its sanctum, one that fuses with a square plan for the mandapa. This design seems to have borrowed influences from early apsidal Buddhist Chaitya Caves such as the Karla Chaitya.[12]

          It is the largest of a group of over 120 temples at Aihole and illustrates a mature example of the Badami Chalukya architecture.[13] The architecture of the temple is sophisticated as it combines an apsidal plan for the sanctum (garbhagriya) with a non-apsidal Nagara-latina shikhara with roots in North Indian architecture. In other parts such as the mandapa, it uses a mix of rectangular and 
          square plans, all fronted by a mukhacatuski-style entrance. It integrates an ambulatory passage within. This fusion of north and south Indian ideas on architecture is not disjointed, but one well integrated. For example, the adhisthana is formulated by a Nagara khura-kumbha, and the decoration with it is Dravida.
