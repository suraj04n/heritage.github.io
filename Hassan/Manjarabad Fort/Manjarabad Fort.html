        <p>Manjarabad fort is a star fort built in 1792 by Tipu Sultan the then Sarvadhakari/ruling on behalf of Mysore King of Mysore  following French star-shaped
           fort designs made popular by SÃ©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban that deflect cannon fire and allow guns to cover all approaches without dead positions. It is in 
           the Hassan district in the Indian state of Karnataka.<br><br><b>Location:</b><br>The fort is located in Sakaleshpura taluk, 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) away from 
           the Sakaleshpura town to its south west, which is on the right bank of the Hemavati River, 23 miles (37 km) from Hassan on the National Highway 75 that runs
            from Bangalore to Mangalore.

           Since the fort is located on a hill at an elevation of 988 metres (3,241 ft), it gives a clear and commanding view of the surroundings. On a clear day, even 
           Arabian sea can also be seen from the fort.<br><br><b>History:</b><br>Tipu Sultan built the fort in 1792 at a time when he was establishing his sovereignty
            over Mysore, fighting against other South Indian dynasties. At this time even the Marathas and</div><div> the Nizam of Hyderabad had aligned with the British. The Sultan
             wanted to make the highway between Mangalore and Coorg secure for his expansion programmes. Because he was allied with the French at that time against the British,
              he sought the help of French engineers to build a star fort of the European style.<br>The completed fort was inspected by Tipu Sultan who then found it enveloped 
              in fog and hence named it as Manjarabad fort; the name Manjara is a version of 'manju' meaning "fog or mist" in Kannada.<br><br><b>Features:</b><br>
              The fort, as built and existing, is an eight-pointed star. The external walls of the fort have been built with granite stones and lime mortar while the
               interior buildings, which accommodate army barracks, armoury, stores and others, have been built with fired bricks. Apart from these, two cellars were built
                next to a deep well which were underground structures used to store gunpowder, and these rooms remained cool even during summer months. The fort has sloping 
                walls. It is said that the fort is "the most complete Vaubanesque star-shaped fort in India".<br>Tourism is not well developed in the area. The Tourism Department
                 of Karnataka, pressed by demands from local people of Sakaleshpura, have plans to create basic amenities around the fort and also develop a park.
