        <p>The Gommateshwara statue is a 57-foot (17 m) high monolithic statue on Vindhyagiri Hill in the town of Shravanbelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka.
           Carved of a single block of granite, it is one of the tallest monolithic statues in the ancient world.<br>The Gommateshwara statue is dedicated to the Jain
            figure Bahubali and symbolises the Jain precepts of peace, non-violence, sacrifice of worldly affairs, and simple living. It was built around 983 CE during
             the Western Ganga dynasty and is one of the largest free-standing statues in the world. It was regarded the tallest Jain statue until 2016.The construction
              of the statue was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty minister and commander Chavundaraya. Neighbouring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several 
              images of the Tirthankaras. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola. The other is Chandragiri, which is also a seat of several ancient 
              Jain centres, much older than Gommateshwara statue. Chandragiri is dedicated to the Jain figure Bharat, the brother of Bahubali and the son of the first
               Tirthankara Rishabhnath.<br>A Jain event known as Mahamastakabhisheka attracts devotees from all over the world. The Mahamastakabhisheka festival is held
                once every 12 years, when the Gommateshwara statue is ritually bathed in milk, saffron, ghee, sugarcane juice (ishukrasa), etc. German Indologist Heinrich
                 Zimmer attributed this anointment as the reason for the statue's freshness. The next abhishekam (ritual bathing) will be in 2030.<br>In 2007, the statue
                  was voted the first of Seven Wonders of India in a Times of India poll; 49% of the total votes went in favour of it.The Archaeological Survey of
                   India has listed the Gommateshwara statue in a group of monuments in Shravanabelagola known as the Adarsh Smarak Monument.<br><br><b>Legend:</b><br>
                   According to legend, after completing construction of Gommateshwara statue, Chavundaraya organised a mahamastakabhisheka with five liquids, milk, tender
                    coconut, sugar, nectar and water collected in hundreds of</div><div> pots but liquid could not flow below the navel of the statue. Kushmandini appeared disguised
                     as a poor old woman holding milk in the shell of half of a white Gullikayi fruit and the abhisheka was done from head to toe. Chavundaraya realised his 
                     mistake and did abhishek without pride and arrogance and this time abhisheka was done from head to toe.
