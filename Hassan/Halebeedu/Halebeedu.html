        <p>Hoysaleswara temple, also referred simply as the Halebidu temple, is a 12th-century Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is the largest monument in
           Halebidu, a town in the state of Karnataka, India and the former capital of the Hoysala Empire. The temple was built on the banks of a large man-made lake, 
           and sponsored by King Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala Empire. Its construction started around 1121 CE and was complete in 1160 CE. During the early
            14th century, Halebidu was twice sacked and plundered by the Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate from northern India, and the temple and the
             capital fell into a state of ruin and neglect. It is 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Hassan city and about 210 kilometres (130 mi) from Bengaluru<br>
             The Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism,
              as well as images from Jainism. The Hoysaleswara temple is a twin-temple dedicated to Hoysaleswara and Santaleswara Shiva lingas, named after the
               masculine and feminine aspects, both equal and joined at their transept. It has two Nandi shrines outside, where each seated Nandi face the respective 
               Shiva linga inside.The temple includes a smaller sanctum for the Hindu Sun god Surya. It once had superstructure towers, but no longer and the 
               temple looks flat. The temple faces east, though the monument is presently visited from the north side. Both the main temples and the Nandi shrines 
               are based on a square plan. The temple was </div><div>carved from soapstone. It is notable for its sculptures, intricate reliefs, detailed friezes as well its
                history, iconography, inscriptions in North Indian and South Indian scripts. The temple artwork provides a pictorial window into the life and culture in 
                the 12th century South India. About 340 large reliefs depict the Hindu theology and associated legends. Numerous smaller friezes narrate Hindu texts
                 such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. Some friezes below large reliefs portray its narrative episodes.<br><br><b>Location:</b>
                 <br>The Hoysaleswara Temple is in Halebidu, also called Halebeedu, Halebid, Dorasamudra. Halebidu is a town in Hassan district of the Indian state
                  of Karnataka. It is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northwest of Hassan.[9] The temple is about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Belur, Karnataka temples. 
                  Halebidu has no nearby airport, and is about 210 kilometres (130 mi) west of Bengaluru (IATA Code: BLR), about 4 hours drive accessible with a four
                   lane NH75 highway through Hassan. Halebidu is connected by railway network at Hassan to major cities of Karnataka.<br><br><b>History:</b><br>
                   The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 9
                   58 centres.[17] Halebidu was originally called Dorasamudra in its inscriptions, possibly derived from Dvarasamudra (Sanskrit words "Dvara" (gateway,
                    door) and Samudra (ocean, sea, large water body)). The capital used to be Belur, Karnataka, but Dorasamudra became the established capital under
                     king Vishnuvardhana and served as the capital of the Hoyasala Empire for nearly 300 years.<br>Unlike other Hoysala temples that have survived 
                     into the modern age, and despite numerous inscriptions in the temple premises, the Hoysaleswara Temple lacks a dedication inscription.
                      It is likely lost, along with the many other features of the original temple. An inscription found about five kilometers from the temple site, 
                      near the Kallesvara temple ruins in Ghattadahalli, states that Ketamalla â€“ officer in the employ of king Vishnuvardhana constructed this temple.
                       It also notes that the king made grant of lands to support the construction, the operation and the maintenance of the Shiva temple in Saka 1043,
                        or 1121 CE.[12] It was not the only temple built in that era. The inscriptions suggest that the capital consisted of numerous other temples, both
                         of Hinduism and Jainism traditions, along with stepwells, ponds and mantapas (mandapas, public halls) in the vicinity of the large Dorasamudhra
                          lake.[19] It is the largest temple built by the Hoysalas that is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in South India.
