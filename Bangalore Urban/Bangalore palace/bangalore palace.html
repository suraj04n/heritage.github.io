        <p>Bangalore Palace is a 19th century royal palace located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, in an area that was owned by the Rev. John Garrett, the first
           principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now famous as Central College. The commencement of the construction of the palace is attributed to
            him.<br><br><b>History:</b><br>Bangalore Palace stands on a piece of land originally owned by Reverend J Garrett, who was the principal of Bangalore
             Central High School. In 1873, the land was purchased at a cost of 40,000 rupees by the British guardians of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X, who was
              a minor then. The property was purchased to provide a suitable place for the young</div><div> Maharaja to stay in Bangalore and complete his administrative training.
              <br>The construction of the palace started in 1874 and was completed by 1878. John Cameron, who was also the superintendent of Lal Bagh Botanical Gardens,
               carried out the landscaping of the property. Over the years, the palace witnessed several improvements and additions. Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar added
                the platform for musicians and the twin external staircase outside the Durbar Hall during his reign.<br>Since 1970, the palace has been at the center of 
                several legal tussles. At present, Bangalore Palace is under the ownership and control of Smt. Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, who is the legal heir to Sri Srikantadatta
                Narasimharaja Wadiyar, a descendant of the Wadiyar royal family. The palace has been opened for public visits since 2005.

              <br><br><b>Architecture:</b><br>Bangalore Palace is built in the Tudor Revival style of architecture, complete with turrets, battlements, a ballroom, and fortified towers.
               It is a two-level palace with Roman arches marking the entrance. The sprawling palace covers a floor area of 45000 sq. ft. while the palace grounds spread over
                454 acres. Impressive furniture featuring Victorian, neo-classical, and Edwardian elements adorn the palace interiors. Elegant wood carvings, cornices, floral
                 motifs, and relief paintings done on the ceiling further add to the beauty of the interiors. This regal edifice also boasts of stained glass and mirrors imported
                  from England as well as wooden fans that lend the palace an old-world charm.  <br>There are around 35 rooms in the palace, most of which are bedrooms, and a swimming pool.
                   The open courtyard within the edifice attracts attention due to the fluorescent blue ceramic tiles used in its decor. One of the major highlights of the palace is
                    its elaborately decorated Durbar Hall that has a huge elephant head adorning it. Situated on the first floor, the hall features stained glass windows and has a 
                    screen demarcating the area behind which women used to sit and watch the assembly proceedings in the bygone days. <br><br><b>Things to See in the Bangalore
