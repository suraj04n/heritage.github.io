        <p>Vidhana Soudha (lit. 'Legislative House') in Bangalore, India, is the seat of the state legislature of Karnataka. It is constructed in a style described 
          as Neo-Dravidian, and incorporates elements of various Dravidian styles. Construction was started in 1952 and completed in 1956.<br>The two houses of legislature of the princely 
          state of Mysore, the legislative assembly and the legislative council, were established in 1881 and 1907 respectively. Sessions of the two houses took place in 
          Mysore (with joint sessions taking place in the Bangalore Town Hall) until India's independence from British rule on 15 August 1947, when Mysore acceded to India.
           The state's capital was shifted to Bangalore; the two houses moved into Attara Kacheri, a British-built building in Cubbon Park that housed the High Court of<br>
           A need was felt for more spacious quarters for the legislature than Attara Kacheri, and in</div><div> April 1951. The foundation stone of the building was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru,
            the first Prime Minister of India, on 13 July 1951. The structure was planned to be a two-storeyed building housing the assembly and the council.
            Mysore.<br>Kengal Hanumanthaiah succeeded K. C. Reddy as Chief Minister of Mysore after a 1952 election.Calling the existing plan a "plain and simple type of American architecture",
             Hanumanthaiah ordered extensive revisions to produce "a work of art in keeping with the tradition of Mysore State". Apart from house chambers,
              the revised plan included government offices, archives, a library and a banquet hall. Construction of the building was completed in 1956. Hanumanthiah 
              personally supervised and ordered several particular aspects of the construction; one of them was to inscribe "Government Work Is God's Work" and its Kannada 
              equivalent on the entablature of the front facade. The final design was meant to dwarf the British-built Attara Kacheri, currently the seat of the Karnataka 
              High Court, opposite which Vidhana Soudha was being built.<br><br><b>Construction:</b><br>White granite from Magadi and Turuvekere was used in the construction. Around 5,000 labourers and 1,500 stonecutters were employed.

              Estimates of construction costs for the original two-storied structure stood at 33 lakh (3.3 million) rupees. The final cost of construction of the redesigned building was 180 lakh (18 million)
               rupees. Hanumanthaiah was criticised for the inflated sum - equivalent to ₹170 crore, or ₹1.7 billion (US$21 million) in 2019 - spent on construction.<br><br><b>Architecture:</b><br>
               Built with granite, Vidhana Soudha is the largest legislative building in India. It measures 213.36 by 106.68 metres (700.0 by 350.0 ft) on the ground and is 53.34 metres (175.0 ft) tall. The architecture
                includes elements of styles from the mediaeval Chalukya, Hoysala and Vijayanagara empires of Karnataka. Its east-facing front facade has a porch with
                 12 granite columns, 12 metres (40 ft) tall. Leading to the porch is a flight of stairs with 45 steps, more than 61 metres (200 ft) wide. The central dome,
                  18 metres (60 ft) in diameter, is crowned by a likeness of the State Emblem of India.<br>The phrase "Government Work is God's Work" and its Kannada equivalent 
                  "Sarkarada kelasa devara kelasa" (in Kannada script as "ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಕೆಲಸ ದೇವರ ಕೆಲಸ") are inscribed on the entablature.[1] In 1957, the Mysore government planned 
                  to replace the inscription with Satyameva Jayate at a cost of ₹7,500 (equivalent to ₹750,000 or US$9,400 in 2023),[9] but the change did not take place. In 1996,
                   the inscription inspired a visiting US state governor, George Voinovich of Ohio, to propose etching "With God, all things are possible" onto the Ohio Statehouse,
                    prompting a high-profile lawsuit.
