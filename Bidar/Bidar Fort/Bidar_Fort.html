        <p>Bidar Fort is located in old city area, Bidar, Karnataka, India. The fort, the city and the district are all affixed with the name Bidar. 
          Sultan Ahmad Shah I of the Bahmanid dynasty shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar in 1427 and built his fort along with a number of Islamic monuments. There are over 30 monuments inside Bidar fort.
          <br>The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate. The Bidar Fort 
          has stood witness to a lot of historical milestones – the rise and fall of Bahmani dynasty, rise and separation of the five Deccan Sultans, capture by the Barid Shahi and Adil Shahi dynasties, and finally 
          being won by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the blockade of Bidar in 1657.<br>Bidar was the capital of Bahmani Kingdom in the 14th century. This fort was built by Ahmed Shah Wali Bahmani. The Fort was
           renovated in the 15th century by Sultan Ahmad Shah-I as he shifted his capital from Kalaburagi (Gulbarga) to Bidar.<br><br><b>Geography:</b><br></div><div>Bidar city and fort are located on the edge of the Bidar
            plateau, the northernmost in Karnataka state. The plateau area, comprising low laterite hills, ends to the north at the Manjira River, a major tributary of the Godavari River. The Karanja River,
             a sub-tributary, drains the surrounding low-lying areas and feeds into the Manjiri River. Bidar district comprises the only part of the Godavari basin in Karnataka.<br>
             Geologically, Bidar district is predominantly Deccan Trap with underlying layers of gneiss emerging along the eastern boundary.[7] The plateau has an altitude of 2,200 feet (670 m),
              and measures 22 miles (35 km) in length and 12 miles (19 km) in width at its broadest. The plateau encompasses a total area of 190 square kilometres (73 sq mi). Bidar fort is built in the
               form of an irregular rhombus on the edge of the plateau with sheer walls built along the North and the East.<br>The ancient capital Kalyani (Basavakalyan) of the Western Chalukya Empire is
                situated about 40 miles (64 km) to the west of Bidar.<br><br><b>History:</b><br>Bidar fort was built by Ahmed Shah Wali Bahmani; the exact layout of the old fort, with its double lines of
                 defensive fortifications,is no longer discernible. Folklore suggests that the old fort was located in the western portion of the fort's present-day extent, from the Takht Mahal to the Kalmadi
                  gate and the promontory on which Virasangayya's temple was built, with the old water tank at the base of its walls.[9] This is confirmed in historical record in Tarikh-i Firishta, by the Persian 
                  scholar Firishta (1560-1620 CE), which states that the Government House or Darul Imara, today known as Takht Mahal, was built on the site of the old fort.<br>The old fort of Bidar was captured in
                   1321-22 AD by Prince Ulugh Khan of the Tughlaq dynasty from the Kakatiya dynasty, who later on became Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi.<br>With the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate (1347), 
                   Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422–1436), Bidar was made the capital city of Bahmani Kingdom.[2] Under Ahmed Shah's rule, the old Fort was rebuilt,
                    and beautiful madrasas, mosques, palaces and gardens were raised. Firishta records that the reconstruction began in 1429 CE and ended in 1432 CE.[9] As gunpowder had not yet been introduced into peninsular 
                    India, long and winding fort walls were constructed out of stone and mortar by Persian and Turkish architects, the stone being provided from the moat, which was excavated by Hindu masons.<br><br><b>Architecture:</b><br>
                    The present-day Bidar fortress was rebuilt using red laterite stone around the old fort in 1428 by Ahmed Shah Bahmani.[6] Constructed on the edge of the plateau, Bidar fort has a haphazard rhombus-shaped layout.
                     The fort is 0.75 mi (1.21 km) long by 0.5 mi (0.80 km) in breadth.[citation needed] The fort walls measure 2.5 km (1.6 mi) on the outside,[9] and include within numerous buildings, arches, pavilions, mosques, gateways and gardens.
                      To the north and east, steep cliffs provide natural protection to the moat and the glacis; elsewhere, facing Bidar city, from the south-east to the south-west, the walls are protected by a unique triple-channeled moat, described by 
                      Yazdani (1995) as follows:<br>The width of the moat between the glacis and the first partition wall is 32 feet 6 inches [9.91 m], between the first and second partition-walls 36 feet 4 inches, and between the second partition wall
                       and the scarp 41 feet 9 inches [12.73 m]. The depth of the moat is 30 feet, and the height of the scarp above the rock-base on which it is built varies from 32 feet 8 inches to 43 feet [13 m].<br><br><b>Gates:</b><br>The seven gates 
                       of the fort are named from East to West as follows:<br>->Gate 1 - The Mandu Darwaza, the main gatex<br>
                       ->Gate 2 - The Kalmadgi Darwaza,<br>
                       ->Gate 5 - The Delhi Darwaza,<br>
                       ->Gate 6 - The Kalyani Darwaza,<br>
                       ->Gate 7 - The Carnatic Darwaza,<br>
                       ->Gates 3 and 4 are without a name.
