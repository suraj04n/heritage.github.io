        <p>The Bahmani tombs complex at Bidar is the necropolis of the Bahmani dynasty, located in Bidar, in the Indian state of Karnataka.<br>Built during the 15th and 16th centuries, the tombs are an example 
          of a distinct Indo-Islamic style of architecture unique to the Deccan, drawing heavily from Persian architecture, with considerable Hindu influences.<br>The architectural style is a regional variant of
           Indo-Islamic architecture unique to the Deccan, with considerable Persian influences such as the use of encaustic tiles, as well as influences from Hindu temple architecture. The Bahmani rulers generally
            employed Persian architects who would design the main featured of the buildings, while Hindu masons and craftsmen would supervise the construction and fill in the details.<br>There are eight tombs of the
             Bahmani rulers,[6] as well as tombs of other family members. The tombs are square structures surmounted by bulbous domes, built of black trap masonry laid in lime. Some of the tombs had elaborate external
              tile decoration, in the form of floral motifs, Islamic geometric patterns, and calligraphy. The inscriptions of the tomb reveal the name of the king, his date of accession, and date of death. Persian poetry 
              and Quranic verses are also inscribed.</div><div><br><br><b>History:</b><br>The Bahmani Sultanate ruled 
          the Deccan region in South India between the 14th and 16th centuries. The sultans and members of the ruling family were buried in elaborate tombs built in a unique Indo-Islamic style of architecture. The
          tombs of earlier rulers are found in the Haft Gumbaz complex at Gulbarga, which was the capital of the sultanate.<br>In 1432, Ahmad Shah I Wali shifted the capital from Gulbarga to Bidar, and consequently,
           the later sultans are buried here. The tombs were erected from 1436 to 1535, with the tomb of Ahmad Shah being the first.<br>The tombs of eight Bahmani sultans, as well as some queens and other family
            members, are located at the complex. The decline in size of the later tombs corresponds with the decline of the political influence of the Bahmanis.<br>In 1527, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five
             successor states, known as the Deccan Sultanates. Bidar came under the rule of the Barid Shahi dynasty, who are buried in the Barid Shahi tombs complex.

                           which resembles Lodi domes in terms of design. The exterior is further embellished by a parapet wall of arch-heads above the walls, and ornate turrets at the corners.[10] Several levels of
                            arched niches adorn the exterior.<br>The interior of the tomb of Ahmad Shah is decorated with frescoes. The panels above the entrance arches contain religious texts in the Kufic script, 
                            and verses by Shah Nimatullah Wali in the Thuluth script. The ceiling is decorated with calligraphy of the names of Allah, Muhammad, Ali, and his descendants.<br>The tomb is venerated as
                             a dargah by Muslims as well as Hindus of the lingayat sect, who take part in the Urs (death anniversary observance) of Ahmad Shah every year.

      <p><b>Tomb of Ala-ud-Din Shah:</b><br>Alau-ud-din Shah succeeded his father Ahmad Shah in 1436, and probably built the tomb during his lifetime. The square mausoleum has lofty entrance arches on three sides. Each entrance
         arch is flanked by a pair of smaller arches on either side. A trefoil-patterned parapet rises above the walls.<br>The facade of the tomb is covered in enamel tiles, most of which have been lost due to deterioration by 
         the weather and vandalism.[1][17] The tiles, Persian blue, green, and, yellow in colour, comprise calligraphic designs and floral motifs. The ceiling of the dome was originally painted, however, only a few fragments of paint survive.

  <p><b>Incomplete tombs of Nizam Shah and Muhammad Shah III:</b><br>Nizam Shah ascended the throne at the age of eight, and ruled for two years between 1461 and 1463. His tomb was probably intended to be similar in size to the earlier tombs,
     given the thickness of the walls. It is thought to have been commissioned by his mother Malika-i-Jahan, and remained unfinished on account of her death. The square hall contains five arches on each face. The entrance is through the southern
      side, and the interior of the western wall is in the form of a mihrab.<br>Muhammad Shah III Lashkari succeeded his brother, and ruled for nineteen years until his death in 1482. His tomb is also incomplete, and of a similar design to the tomb
      of Nizam Shah. There are three graves within the enclosure, the middle one of which is the grave of Muhammad Shah III.

  <p><b>Tombs of Wali-ullah and Kalim-ullah:</b><br>Wali-ullah (r. 1522–1525) and Kalim-ullah (r. 1525–2527) were the last Bahmani rulers, both ruling as puppet monarchs under prime minister Amir Barid. Their tombs are small square structures
     with conical domes. The tomb of Kalim-ullah is slightly larger, and is crowned with a cylindrical pinnacle.

  <p><b>Chaukhandi:</b><br>The Chaukhandi is situated about a kilometer west of the main necropolis. It is the tomb of Khalil-ullah Kirmani, a Sufi saint and spiritual advisor to Ahmad Shah. It is a double-storied octagonal structure, 
    and is similar in style to the tomb of Ala-ud-din. It was decorated with encaustic tiles, of which only a few remain.<br>In later times, several vaults were built for the graves of Khalil-ullah's descendants, one of which is attached
     to the Chaukhandi. A small domed sepulchre is situated at the south-western face of the Chaukhandi. It is not known who was buried here.
